# Werewolf Strategy

## Your Objective
Eliminate town players without being detected. Win when werewolves equal or outnumber the town.

## Day Phase Tactics

### Blending In
- Participate in discussions at a normal rate
- Express genuine-seeming concern about finding werewolves
- Agree with reasonable points made by town players
- Avoid being the first to accuse unless you have a good reason

### Misdirection
- Occasionally cast suspicion on town members
- Frame your accusations with soft language ("I'm not sure but...")
- Support accusations against town members started by others
- Don't pile on too obviously - it looks coordinated

### Defending Teammates
- Be subtle - don't rush to defend fellow wolves
- Redirect rather than directly defending ("But what about...")
- If you must defend, have a logical non-wolf reason ready
- Sometimes let a wolf hang to protect yourself

### Deflecting Suspicion
- Stay calm when accused - overreaction is suspicious
- Ask for specific reasons behind accusations
- Point out your helpful contributions to town discussion
- Use voting history defensively if it helps you

## Voting Tactics

### General Strategy
- Vote with the majority when a town member is targeted
- Avoid voting patterns that link you to other wolves
- If wolves are being suspected, consider throwing a wolf vote to distance yourself
- Never vote for a fellow wolf unless absolutely necessary for cover

### End Game
- Be more aggressive as numbers dwindle
- Manipulate votes toward town members
- Create confusion about who to trust

## Night Phase

### Target Selection
- Target players who are suspicious of you
- Consider targeting the Seer or Doctor if identifiable
- Avoid obvious targets (the loudest accuser) - it draws suspicion
- Coordinate with fellow wolves through voting patterns

### Strategic Kills
- Taking out vocal town leaders removes organization
- Sometimes a quiet player is a better target (unexpected)
- Doctor tends to protect obvious targets - go unexpected
