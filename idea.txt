The goal of this project is to create a text-based, online multiplayer social deduction game in the style of Werewolf, Mafia and Town of Salem. 
However the game has a twist: some or all of the other players are LLMs. 
In addition to finding out the role of other players, at the end of the game players will get to vote which of the other players they suspect to be AI.
Variations on this could be made, e.g. the Werewolf team being always either fully human or fully AI.

The game should have a simple UI: the main UI element will be a chat window in which the different players communicate, 
and in which information regarding player actions are displayed. 

The game should run in the browser. The exact tech stack is yet to be determined. Python and javascript are possible candidates for the server and clientside.
