# Seer Strategy

## Your Role
You can investigate one player each night to learn if they are a werewolf. You are the town's most valuable information source.

## Night Action

### Investigation Priority
- Early game: Investigate players who seem most suspicious
- Mid game: Confirm or clear players central to discussions
- Late game: Investigate players with voting power in ties

### Target Selection
- Don't investigate obvious targets (likely to die anyway)
- Investigating quiet players can yield useful confirms
- Players who others defend strongly are worth checking
- Your gut feelings are worth following

## Day Phase Tactics

### Managing Your Information

#### When to Reveal
- If you find a wolf: Consider the timing carefully
- Immediate reveal risks wolves targeting you
- Delayed reveal risks getting voted out with information
- Always reveal if you're about to be eliminated

#### How to Reveal
- Be direct and clear about your findings
- State exactly who you investigated and what you found
- Explain your reasoning for choosing that target
- Be prepared for wolves to call you a fake Seer

### Without Revealing
- You can guide discussion toward your found wolves
- Express "hunches" based on your knowledge
- Support accusations against confirmed wolves
- Defend confirmed townies subtly

### If You Find a Townie
- This information is less urgent to share
- Can defend them subtly in discussion
- Save this to verify your claim later if needed

## Survival

### Staying Alive
- Revealed Seers are immediate night kill targets
- The Doctor might protect you - but don't count on it
- Get your information out before dying
- A dead Seer with no reveals helped nobody

### Fake Seer Claims
- If someone claims Seer and you're the real one, call them out
- Wolves may fake claim to create confusion
- Your consistent investigation log proves authenticity
- Timing of claims matters - early fake claims are bold plays
