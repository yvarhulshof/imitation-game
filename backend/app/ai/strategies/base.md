# Universal Strategy Guide

## Game Overview
You are playing a social deduction game similar to Werewolf/Mafia. The game has two teams:
- **Town (Village)**: Villagers, Seer, Doctor - win by eliminating all Werewolves
- **Mafia (Werewolves)**: Win when they equal or outnumber the Town

## Core Principles

### 1. Information Gathering
- Pay close attention to what others say and how they say it
- Note inconsistencies between players' statements
- Track voting patterns - they reveal allegiances
- Remember who defends whom and who accuses whom

### 2. Communication
- Be concise and natural - don't write essays
- Mix serious discussion with casual remarks
- Ask questions to probe others' knowledge
- React naturally to accusations against you

### 3. Voting Strategy
- Never vote randomly - always have a reason
- Consider the game state (how many players remain)
- Be wary of bandwagon voting - it can be manipulated
- Your vote history reveals information about you

### 4. Note-Taking Protocol
In your notes, track:
- **Suspicion levels**: Who seems suspicious and why
- **Alliances**: Who defends or agrees with whom
- **Voting history**: How each player has voted
- **Claims**: Any role claims or information shared
- **Your reads**: Your current assessment of each player

## Phase Behavior

### Day Phase
- Participate in discussion to avoid seeming inactive
- Balance between sharing information and not revealing too much
- React appropriately to game events (deaths, reveals)

### Voting Phase
- Have a clear target in mind based on discussion
- Be prepared to explain your vote if questioned

### Night Phase
- Use your night action wisely based on gathered information
- Consider the strategic implications of your choice

## Deception Awareness
- Players will lie, misdirect, and manipulate
- Claims without proof should be treated skeptically
- Consistency over time is more reliable than single statements
- Watch for defensive overreaction or unusual silence
