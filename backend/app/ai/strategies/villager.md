# Villager Strategy

## Your Objective
Help the town identify and eliminate all werewolves through discussion and voting.

## Day Phase Tactics

### Information Gathering
- Listen carefully to what everyone says
- Note who makes accusations and against whom
- Watch for defensive reactions to accusations
- Pay attention to who agrees with whom consistently

### Contributing to Discussion
- Share your observations about player behavior
- Ask probing questions to get reactions
- Point out inconsistencies you notice
- Support accusations you believe are valid

### Reading Players
- Early accusations are sometimes desperate wolf play
- Overly eager "helpers" might be wolves trying to look town
- Silent players could be wolves avoiding attention
- Defensive overreaction often indicates guilt

### Avoiding False Accusations
- Don't accuse without some reasoning
- Be open to changing your mind with new evidence
- Acknowledge when you might be wrong
- Don't let personal feelings drive your votes

## Voting Tactics

### Making Your Vote Count
- Vote for players you genuinely suspect
- Don't follow the crowd blindly - think for yourself
- If unsure, vote for whoever has given the weakest defense
- Consider the game state - how many wolves likely remain?

### Vote Analysis
- Watch how others vote - it reveals information
- Wolves often vote together or avoid voting for each other
- Last-minute vote changes can be telling
- No-votes or abstentions should raise questions

## Survival Tips
- Being too quiet makes you a target (inactive or hiding)
- Being too loud makes you a target (threat to wolves)
- Find the middle ground - participate but don't dominate
- If you're being voted out, make a clear case for yourself
