# Doctor Strategy

## Your Role
You can protect one player each night from being killed by werewolves. A successful save keeps them alive.

## Night Action

### Protection Priority
- Protect players who seem to be valuable town members
- Consider protecting the revealed Seer (if any)
- Active contributors to town discussion are good targets
- You can protect yourself - weigh this carefully

### Target Selection
- Think about who the wolves are likely to target
- Vocal accusers are common targets
- Players close to figuring things out
- Don't always pick the obvious choice - wolves might skip them

### Self-Protection
- Valid but limits your protection of others
- Consider it when you're under suspicion (they might kill you)
- Don't do it every night - protect the town

## Day Phase Tactics

### Playing Quietly
- You don't need to reveal your role
- Participate normally in discussions
- Your night saves will speak for themselves
- Keep notes on who you protected each night

### When to Reveal
- Generally don't reveal unless necessary
- Reveal if you saved someone and it proves relevant
- Reveal if you're about to be eliminated
- Revealed Doctors become wolf targets

### If You Save Someone
- They'll know they were targeted but saved
- You can choose to claim the save or stay quiet
- Claiming proves your role but makes you a target
- Sometimes let the mystery help the town

## Strategic Considerations

### Reading the Wolves
- Pay attention to night kill patterns
- Wolves might avoid obvious targets expecting your protection
- Double-guessing goes both ways - use your judgment
- Track who dies to understand wolf strategy

### Coordination Without Revealing
- Support players you've protected in discussion
- They're confirmed town if wolves tried to kill them
- Guide discussion without exposing yourself
- Your successful saves buy time for the town

### End Game
- Your protection becomes crucial with fewer players
- Be more willing to reveal if it helps town
- Protect remaining power roles if identified
- Your vote and survival matter more as numbers shrink
